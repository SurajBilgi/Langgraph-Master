Suraj is a seasoned AI/ML Engineer with over four years of hands-on experience designing, developing, and deploying intelligent systems across a spectrum of industries, including healthcare, enterprise automation, and 3D environment reconstruction. With a strong foundation in both traditional machine learning and cutting-edge deep learning techniques, he has consistently delivered robust, scalable, and production-ready AI solutions that drive tangible business impact.

He began his career at Resolute AI Software, where he architected real-time AI services using OpenCV and LSTMs to detect anomalous user behavior in video feeds—drastically reducing manual monitoring workloads. At the same time, he spearheaded initiatives to modernize ML workflows by migrating legacy models to AWS SageMaker, implementing RESTful model endpoints using API Gateway and Lambda, and leveraging ensemble learning for predictive analytics in sales and customer churn domains. His work laid a strong foundation in MLOps, cloud-native deployment, and operational AI.

Building on this foundation, Suraj joined iNeuron Intelligence, where he delved deeper into medical AI applications. He developed a CNN-based diagnostic model for diabetic retinopathy, achieving a 91% AUC score in clinical-grade image classification. Simultaneously, he led NLP-driven solutions to extract structured patient information from unstructured EHRs using spaCy, regex-based pipelines, and later transitioned into Large Language Models. He successfully integrated GPT-4 via LangChain for summarizing diagnostic reports, enhancing clinical decision-making across multiple departments. His solutions significantly improved data extraction, patient care workflows, and risk prediction in clinical settings.

Currently, at Tracker Groups LLC, Suraj plays a pivotal role in pushing the frontiers of applied AI in 3D spatial understanding and advanced analytics. He engineered a 3D reconstruction pipeline using LiDAR data and Open3D, integrated with semantic segmentation, resulting in a 40% throughput gain in rendering environments for indoor spaces. His role extends into backend engineering and MLOps, having built and deployed secure FastAPI-based microservices integrated with AWS SQS, JWT authentication, and Dockerized workflows. His contributions include model dashboards using MLflow, object detection with CNNs, document classification using RNNs, and BERT/GPT-based NLP systems for sentiment and intent classification. Across these projects, he has repeatedly demonstrated a unique blend of deep technical skills, software engineering rigor, and product-centric thinking.

Technically, Suraj is fluent in Python and adept with the ML/DL ecosystem, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, and LangChain. His statistical modeling expertise spans hypothesis testing, predictive analytics, and unsupervised learning techniques. His ML infrastructure skills are equally strong—he’s well-versed in AWS (SageMaker, EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, ECS), GCP (Vertex AI), CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and Terraform. He also brings robust experience with databases like PostgreSQL, Redis, and Neo4j, and tools like Apache Airflow and MLflow for workflow automation and experiment tracking.

Suraj holds a Master’s degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence from Stevens Institute of Technology. He is AWS Certified and has completed a specialization in Generative AI with LLMs. Passionate about solving complex problems with AI, his current focus lies in building intelligent systems that combine perception (vision), understanding (NLP/LLMs), and action (decision-making) to create transformative real-world solutions.
